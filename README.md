# postcode-level-variables

This project utilised census data at the postcode level downloaded from the [ABS website](https://datapacks.censusdata.abs.gov.au/datapacks/)  

The following options were selected:  
 
*  Step 1: 2016 Census Datapacks  
*  Step 2: General Community Profile  
*  Step 3: Postal Areas  
*  Geographies: Vic  

The folder **2016_GCP_POA_for_Vic_short-header** was downloaded into the working directory.

Each table from the data folder was then read into R using the script: **Read.ABS.tables.R**
